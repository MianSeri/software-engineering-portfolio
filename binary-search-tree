# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Algorithms, Data Structures

## Overview
This project implements a complete Binary Search Tree from scratch using JavaScript. It focuses on algorithmic thinking, recursion, iteration, and time complexity analysis.

## Key Features
- Insert, search, and delete operations
- Recursive and iterative implementations
- Depth-first traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Breadth-first traversal (BFS)

## Technical Highlights
- Balance checking logic for tree validation
- Second-highest value retrieval
- Iterative in-order traversal using a stack
- Big-O time and space complexity awareness

## Skills Demonstrated
- Algorithms and data structures
- Recursion vs iteration tradeoffs
- Performance optimization
- Clean, testable logic

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the JavaScript file using Node:
   ```bash
   node bst.js
