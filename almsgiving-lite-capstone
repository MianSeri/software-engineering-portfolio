# AlmsGiving Lite — Full-Stack Capstone Project

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Stripe API

## Overview
AlmsGiving Lite is a full-stack donation platform designed to help nonprofit organizations create campaigns, accept donations, and track contributions securely. This project serves as my software engineering capstone and demonstrates end-to-end system design, backend transactions, and third-party payment integration.

## Key Features
- Nonprofit registration and authentication
- Campaign creation and management
- Secure donation processing using Stripe PaymentIntents
- Idempotent payment handling to prevent duplicate charges
- Real-time campaign donation tracking
- RESTful API architecture with modular routing

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented atomic donation confirmation using MongoDB transactions
- Designed idempotency key handling for safe payment retries
- Built protected routes with authentication middleware
- Modeled relational data with Mongoose schemas
- Integrated Stripe webhooks for payment lifecycle handling

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React with controlled forms and API-driven state
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express REST API
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with transactional operations
- **Payments:** Stripe PaymentIntents API

## Skills Demonstrated
- Full-stack system design
- REST API development
- Secure payment processing
- Database transactions and data consistency
- Error handling and production-minded backend logic

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both client and server
3. Set environment variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `MONGODB_URI`
4. Start backend and frontend servers
5. Access the app locally in the browser
