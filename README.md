# software-engineering-portfolio
This repository showcases a curated selection of software engineering projects completed during my transition from customer experience and design into full-stack software development. These projects demonstrate my strengths in JavaScript, APIs, algorithms, backend development, testing, and UI architecture.
What you’ll find here:
Front-end applications using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and APIs
Backend REST APIs built with Node.js and Express
Algorithm and data structure implementations
Emphasis on clean architecture, testing, and maintainability
