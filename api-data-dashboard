Tech Stack: JavaScript, REST APIs, Async/Await, HTML, CSS

## Overview
This project is a dynamic front-end dashboard that fetches and displays data from a third-party REST API. It focuses on asynchronous data handling, UI state management, and clean rendering logic.

## Key Features
- Fetches live data using `fetch` and `async/await`
- Implements loading, success, and error UI states
- Dynamically renders data-driven UI components
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Technical Highlights
- Structured async workflows to prevent UI blocking
- Defensive error handling for failed API requests
- Modular rendering logic for maintainability

## Skills Demonstrated
- API consumption and asynchronous JavaScript
- Front-end state management
- Debugging and error handling
- UI logic and data-driven rendering

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
*(or run via Live Server if applicable)*


This project demonstrates real-world API integration and front-end problem solving.
